canBeEncroached
	"Answer whether my bottom edge can be encroached by horizontal smart-splitter.  If my list is larger than my outermost containing window, go ahead and report true since moving a splitter will never allow my entire list to be displayed.  In that case go ahead and be encroachable to allow lower truncated text-panes to be exposed, but leave a reasonable height (70) to ensure at least few items are displayed."
